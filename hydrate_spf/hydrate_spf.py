    A mechanism is an entry in an SPF record that dictates a server or set of
    servers to approve for mail-sending.

        http://www.openspf.org/RFC_4408#mechanisms

    There are many types of records, but they all eventually resolve to IP
    addresses (or blocks of addresses).  These resolved addresses are what
    we're trying to return.

    When taking in a single address, we should just return it:
    >>> hydrate_mechanism('ip4:66.181.10.77')
    'ip4:66.181.10.77'

    The same thing goes for address blocks:
    >>> hydrate_mechanism('ip4:67.192.241.0/24')
    'ip4:67.192.241.0/24'

    A records should be converted to their resolved IPs.
    >>> hydrate_mechanism('a', 'ifixit.com')
    'ip4:75.101.159.182'

    Even if there are multiple resolutions.
    >>> hydrate_mechanism('a', 'microsoft.com')
    'ip4:134.170.188.221 ip4:65.55.58.201'

    MX records should similarly be resolved.
    >>> hydrate_mechanism('mx', 'ifixit.com')
    'ip4:173.203.2.36 ip4:98.129.184.4'

    An include must do a recursive hydration of the included domain's SPF
    rules.  It will prefer the SPF record...
    >>> hydrate_mechanism('include', 'mailtank.com')
    'ip4:65.50.229.106 ip4:66.181.10.77 ip4:66.181.10.77 ip4:66.181.10.77'

    ...but fall back to SPF TXT records.
